// A SnowyOwl is an Owl whose name is always "Snowy owl". A SnowyOwl will
// randomly eat a hare, a lemming, or a small bird (depending on whatâ€™s available!), where each type of food is equally likely. The SnowyOwl class should
// use a random number to determine which food the SnowyOwl will eat. Assuming that the Owl class has been correctly defined, and given the class hierarchy shown previously, write a complete declaration of the class SnowyOwl,
// including implementation of its constructor and method(s).
